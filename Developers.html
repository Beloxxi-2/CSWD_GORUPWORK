              <p>I am Oluwaseyi Adeyemo (Student Number: 3144255), and for our group website project, I worked on the Tickets and Artist Lineup sections.
                 For the Tickets page, I focused on creating a clear and user-friendly layout that makes it easy for visitors to view ticket options, prices, and how to purchase them.
                  In the Artist Lineup section, I organized the performers(Tems, Jorja, TravisScott) using clean visual layouts that highlight each act and their role in the festival.
                 My goal was to make these sections both informative and engaging for users.</p>

              <p>I'm Ekene Ochuba, and my contribution to our group website project focused on the Merch and Partners pages.
                 For the Merch section, I showcased a selection of festival-themed merchandise designed to appeal to fans, ensuring the layout was clean and visually engaging. On the Partners page, I highlighted the brands and organizations supporting the event (Shein, Nandos,Shein), presenting them in a way that emphasizes their role and adds credibility to the festival.
                 Both pages were crafted to enhance the user experience and reflect the professional image of the event.</p>

              <h2>Isreal</h2>
              <p>I'm Israel, and I was responsible for developing the News and About Wireless Festival sections of our group website project.
                 In the News section, I shared the latest updates and announcements to keep visitors informed about everything happening around the festival.
                  For the About Wireless Festival page, I introduced visitors to Wireless, one of the UK's biggest urban music festivals known for showcasing top hip-hop, rap, and R&B artists. I aimed to highlight the festivalâ€™s vibrant atmosphere, cultural impact, and its role in bringing together fans from all over. 
                My goal was to make these sections engaging and informative while reflecting the spirit of Wireless.</p>

              <p>I am Abdullahi Adedeji (ID:3157843), and for our group website project, I worked on the Experience and Apartments sections.
                 The Experience section highlights moments from past events, giving visitors a sense of the vibrant atmosphere and what they can expect based on previous festivals. For the Apartments page, I showcased accommodation options located in Edinburgh, focusing on en-suite, shared, and single rooms. 
                I designed these sections to be clear and user-friendly, helping users easily explore both the history of the event and their potential stay.</p>
