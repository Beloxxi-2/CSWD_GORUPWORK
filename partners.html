                    From Southern Africa to Portugal to the UK, Nando’s are famous for their flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken. 
                    And their good vibes. It’s not just the food that’s legendary, there’s spice in everything. From the music to the art
                     and even the napkins. Whether you’re grabbing lunch, catching up with friends or feasting with your family, Nando’s 
                     is an uplifting experience that keeps you coming back for more. They’re also hot on supporting emerging talent in 
                     their own Nandocas and beyond. Like the Mix It Up Amapiano EP, recorded at their Soho studio, feeding artists 
                     backstage at some of the UK’s biggest festivals and firing up students at Nando’s Yard. They always keep it spicy. 
                     The food gets an honourable mention, too. PERi-PERi chicken – on or off the bone – sharing platters, salads, burgers, pittas, wraps and plant-based options. Choose your spice from the PERi-ometer and go wild with sides, extras and sauces. Because life’s better when you mix it up.
